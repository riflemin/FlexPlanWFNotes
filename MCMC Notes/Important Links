The following Links helped greatly with my understanding of Monte Carlo Markov Chains and their use cases:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTUwEu53uzs (MCMC Framework, pipeline, metropolis rule) * used in Code.   -> Metropolis Rule is used to conduct random walk. 
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCv2N7wGDCw (Metropolis-Hastings, newer method of metropolis rule) 
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yApmR-c_hKU (MCMC explained, Gibbs sampling) -> Gibbs sampling not used, but could be good to know. It is another method of a random walk.
